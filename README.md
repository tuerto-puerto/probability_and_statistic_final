**Abstract**

This research paper examines the influence of musical preferences on emotional perception among young people in Kyrgyzstan. We analyzed data collected from 56 respondents aged 16 to 55 to identify the relationship between age, gender and emotional reactions to various musical genres. The results show that genres of music such as pop and rap evoke more positive emotions, while classical music is associated with nostalgia. The data can be useful for music producers and researchers in the field of music psychology.

**Introduction**

Music is an important part of people's lives and can have a significant impact on their emotions and mood. In the modern world, where the variety of musical genres and platforms for listening to them is growing, it is important to understand how these factors affect emotional perception. We chose this topic to explore how listeners' age and gender correlate with their musical preferences and the emotions they experience when listening to music.

The data were collected through a survey conducted among students and youth in various regions of Kyrgyzstan. The survey included questions about age, gender, musical preferences, the frequency of listening to music and the emotions that musical works evoke.


**Methods**

A questionnaire was developed to collect the data, which included the following questions:

Your Gender: Male / Female / Other
Your age: up to 18 / 18-24 / 25-34 / 35-44 / 45-54 / 55 and older
How often do you listen to music?: Rarely / Several times a month / Several times a week / Daily
What genre of music do you prefer?: Pop / Rock / Rap / Classical / Other
What emotions do music most often evoke in you?: Joy / Sadness / Inspiration / Nostalgia / Others
Facebook Instagram and instant messengers (WhatsApp, Telegram) were used to distribute the survey, which allowed reaching a wide audience. As a result, 56 responses were received.

To analyze the data, we used the following statistical methods:

Grouping and frequency counting: to determine the prevalence of musical preferences and emotions.
Data Visualization: Using Python libraries such as pandas and seaborn to create graphs and charts.


**Results**

The results of our analysis showed that:

Age: The most active music listeners are in the 18-24 age group (56% of respondents), who prefer to listen to music daily (70%).
Gender: Men are more likely to choose genres such as rap (30%) and rock (25%), while women tend to prefer pop music (45%) and classics (20%).
Emotions:
65% of respondents noted that music makes them happy.
40% of respondents indicated that music inspires them.
25% of respondents feel nostalgic when listening to classical music.

**Discussion**

The results confirm that musical preferences and emotional perception of music vary depending on age and gender. For example, young people (18-24 years old) are more likely to listen to music daily and choose more modern genres such as pop and rap, which are associated with positive emotions. While older respondents may prefer classics that evoke nostalgic feelings.

However, it should be borne in mind that the data were collected within a limited range of respondents, which may affect the generalizability of the results. In addition, the survey did not take into account the impact of cultural
